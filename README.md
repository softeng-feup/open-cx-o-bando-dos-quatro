* ConfView
## Vision
* **Vision** : Find where you are and how to go everywhere on the conference.

* **Description**: A image on spot view of diferent places on the conference, through panoramic view of just photos of conference's places, so that people can have a better orientation of where they are and time-lapse like movement or video that will indicate the shortest path to the place where you want to go from where you are. Given that you might not know where you are, there will be NFC tags or Bluethooth devices spread on the conference that will locate you automatically on the app.

* **Requisits**: NFC or Bluetooth devices for location and database to hold images, locations and paths of the conference.
