## Product
* ConfView
## Vision
* **Vision** : Find where you are and how to go everywhere on the conference.

* **Description**: A image on spot view of diferent places on the conference, through panoramic view of just photos of conference's places, so that people can have a better orientation of where they are and time-lapse like movement or video that will indicate the shortest path to the place where you want to go from where you are. Given that you might not know where you are, there will be NFC tags or Bluethooth devices spread on the conference that will locate you automatically on the app.

* **Requisits**: NFC or Bluetooth devices for location and database to hold images, locations and paths of the conference.
## Elevator Pitch
* When you go to a conference, you go there with which purpose? With the purpose of getting the best and the most of the conference, from the moment we step in. However, from the moment we arrive, we find ourselves in that new space we don’t know and we don’t even know how to go to where we want or need, losing those precious moment of the beginning of a lecture or workshop. For that, the ideal would be an application that would allow us to locate ourselves automatically, anywhere, on any conference, fast and effectively, with the help of a 3D view and a visualization of the path to where we want to go, minimizing the time and effort we need to locate ourselves and to know how to get where we want.
